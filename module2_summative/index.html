                    <p>Hello! My name is Bea, and I am a dedicated 2nd-year Multimedia Arts Student. Welcome to Bea's Basket! A curated portfolio where I share my work, inspirations, and creative journey as I explore the world of digital design. I love capturing moments through the lens and turing ideas into visual designs that speak to people. Whether I'm editing a photo, designing a logo, or working on layouts, I enjoy bringing out beauty and meaning in every project.
                        
                        Outside of my creative work, I enjoy journaling, crocheting, listening to music, watching films, and exploring new places for inspiration. I'm always looking for ways to grow as an artist and connect with others who share my passion for creativity.
                        
                        Feel free to explore my portfolio and connect with me!
