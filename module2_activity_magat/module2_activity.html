            <h3>Flood Control Efforts</h3>
            <p>
                Flooding is a recurring problem in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila 
                and low-lying provinces. The government has been implementing flood control 
                projects such as river dredging, pumping stations, and flood barriers. These 
                efforts aim to protect communities, reduce damage to property, and ensure 
                public safety during typhoons and heavy rainfall. However, the Philippines is currently facing a scandal over “ghost flood control projects,” or projects reported as completed but found to be missing, unfinished, or substandard. In Bulacan, about ₱5.9 billion worth of questionable works have been identified, including a ₱55-million flood wall with no actual construction, while Quezon City flagged 331 projects worth ₱17 billion. The Department of Finance estimates losses of up to ₱118.5 billion from 2023 to 2025 due to these anomalies. In response, the Department of Public Works and Highways has launched inspections, suspended local offices, and rebid projects, while an independent commission investigates and prepares possible legal charges.

    <h3>The Discayas</h3>
    <p>
        The "Discayas" issue refers to a recent controversy that sparked nationwide 
        discussion on governance and accountability. It became a trending topic across 
        social media platforms and news outlets, highlighting concerns about leadership, 
        transparency, and the role of citizens in demanding answers from those in power.
    </p>

    <p>
        In interviews aired from September 2024 to January 2025, veteran broadcasters 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JuliusBabaoUNPLUGGED" target="_blank">Julius Babao</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@korinasanchezroxasofficial" target="_blank">Korina Sanchez</a> 
        featured Sarah and Curlee Discaya—owners of major contractor firms like Alpha &amp; Omega Gen., 
        St. Timothy Construction, and St. Gerrard Construction—which have been named among top recipients of 
        Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) flood control contracts.

        <a href="https://www.philstar.com/" target="_blank">Philstar</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        In Babao’s “Unplugged” YouTube segment titled 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" target="_blank">“Ate Sarah at Kuya Curlee, Dating Mahirap na Naging Bilyonaryo!”</a>, 
        Sarah Discaya told how their construction business improved significantly after getting DPWH projects. 
        (<a href="https://www.pep.ph/" target="_blank">PEP.ph</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.philstar.com/" target="_blank">Philstar</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        In one interview, she openly discussed buying a luxury Rolls-Royce—one of about 40 luxury cars she and her husband own—and explained it 
        by pointing out a feature she liked (“payong” mechanism) rather than utility. 
        (<a href="https://www.pep.ph/" target="_blank">PEP.ph</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        The Korina Sanchez interview, which has since been removed from official channels, similarly portrayed Sarah’s “asenso” (rise) from humble beginnings—from parents working as OFWs, to her growing success in construction, with public attention to their personal lifestyle. 
        (<a href="https://philnews.ph/" target="_blank">PhilNews</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        These interviews have triggered criticism because the Discaya-owned firms are implicated in the so-called ghost flood control projects—projects that are non-existent, incomplete, or poorly constructed. 
        Pasig City Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vico_Sotto" target="_blank">Vico Sotto</a> 
        has questioned whether these interviews amount to paid placements intended to polish public image, particularly since they involve contractors entering politics and allegedly benefiting from DPWH contracts. 
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.philstar.com/life" target="_blank">Philstar Life</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.philstar.com/" target="_blank">Philstar</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        The media teams denied these are paid promos, maintaining the features are lifestyle or success-stories chosen for public interest, not investigative reports. 
        (<a href="https://www.philstar.com/" target="_blank">Philstar</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        The controversy thus raises issues of media ethics, transparency, and the overlap among wealth display, political ambition, and public trust, 
        particularly in contexts where public infrastructure funds are under scrutiny for misuse.

                Image-building for politics – Sotto argued that the interviews, which highlight luxury cars 
                and a “rags-to-riches” story, look like soft PR to clean up the family’s image, especially 
                since members of the Discaya family are running for office.

            <td>
                Editorial independence – They maintained that editorial choices are not dictated by money and

                Ethical concern – Allowing contractors under investigation for anomalies to use mainstream media

            <td>
                Public interest angle – The Discayas’ sudden rise from humble beginnings to billionaires,

            <p>
                Corruption continues to be one of the most pressing issues in the Philippines. 
                It affects government services, economic growth, and public trust. Various 
                advocacy groups and citizens are calling for stronger anti-corruption measures,
