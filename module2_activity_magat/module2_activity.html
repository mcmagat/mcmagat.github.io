            <h3>Flood Control Efforts</h3>
            <p>
                Flooding is a recurring problem in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila 
                and low-lying provinces. The government has been implementing flood control 
                projects such as river dredging, pumping stations, and flood barriers. These 
                efforts aim to protect communities, reduce damage to property, and ensure 
                public safety during typhoons and heavy rainfall.
